Code Temple - CSS & HTML Project Module One
- create by Elliott English

1. This porject is built to demonstrate competency with the basics of CSS and HMTL as taught in Coding Temple Module 1. The course requirements are listed in this document below. 

2. This project is a basic 5 page webpage built only of CSS and HTML as such the contact form is not functional. The location and contents are ficitonal and based on the universe described in Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.  

3. This website is useful practice with all the major functionalities of a front end webpage limited only to html and css. 

4. Note to the evaluator(s): I was initially thinking I would keep all CSS on one page but felt the error of that approach when starting the 3rd/menu page build. I decided to leave the index and events page css together on style.css.

5. I started with the theme and colors which I'm not even sure make sense together, but I want to practce using a palatte origionally sourced from [coolor](https://coolors.co/), and while perhaps not the best choice it was a good simplify and consistency enforcing decision. 

6. I didnt find an example Hamburger menue in websearches without JS so I ultimately used Claude 3.7 for an html and CSS only opiton and went a few rounds troubleshooting the varieties of options it was suggesting wiht each page. Hopefully this is consistent with policy as there is a no AI coding policy and modules suggesting using coding for comments and work checking. 

7. Testing - I have tested large and small configurations of the website with all webpages and features on: Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Edge browser from local hosting on my Mac.  All seemed to work consistently and were somewhat responsive.
